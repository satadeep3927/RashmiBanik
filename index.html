									<p style="white-space: pre-line;">For me, teaching is a calling.  From my earliest childhood memories, I remember loving to play “school.”  This love of the entire process of learning has followed me throughout the changes in my career path.  In any role, regardless of whether I am acting in the formal roles of “instructor” or “student,” I seek to learn and to teach.

                                        Education is my chosen career path.  In my faculty and professional roles, I consider mentoring, supervising and teaching the next generation of thought and practice leaders to be a wonderful privilege.  Giving back to the profession I love and believe in is one of the primary motivators behind my teaching.  By teaching the teachers, I know that my work can have an impact on college students far beyond those with whom I have immediate contact.
                                        
                                        At its core, my teaching is grounded in concepts of student learning and development.  Much as our profession has focused on the education of the whole student, I apply this philosophy to my teaching. My main goal in any teaching endeavor is to encourage the student to explore research and knowledge in order to incorporate it into their own professional point of view.  Teaching in this field requires one to attend to both the technical knowledge a student needs and to their evolution as a reflective professional and person.  Theory and practice are inextricably linked.
                                        
                                        In encouraging this process, I believe it is important to view the student-teacher relationship as one that is co-constructed.  In this regard, I am heavily influenced by the learning partnerships work of Dr. Marcia Baxter Magolda.  Much as I hope students will learn from me, I equally appreciate the learning I take from my students.  In the classroom space, I believe that authority and the responsibility for learning is mutually shared.
                                        
                                        Part of this co-construction requires that I reflect on my own approach, style and biases in the learning process.  It also requires that I recognize that students learn differently, have differing levels of learning abilities, and that my teaching must be sensitive to the individual needs of each student.  In approaching my teaching, I attempt to accommodate the myriad of learning styles present in the classroom.  I utilize a blend of approaches, including reading, writing, discussion, role play, case studies, reflection, and lecture.
                                        
                                        Lastly, I view teaching as a performative act.  Although I attempt to de-center myself in the classroom, I nevertheless recognize that teaching is, in part, a show.  I relish the challenge of trying to take difficult concepts and explore them in accessible, interesting and engaging ways.   I also strive to experiment with new innovative ways of engaging in the learning process.  I am not the only one that benefits from this experimentation.  My students do as well.
                                        
                                        When it comes to education, the process is often the product, and I continually learn as I teach.</p>

								<div class="description">
									<p style="white-space: pre-line;">We live in a world in which the kind of things that are easy to teach and test have also become easy to digitise and automate. Education has won the race with technology throughout history, but there is no automaticity it will do so in the future. Students growing up with a great smartphone but a poor education will face unprecedented risks.

                                        When we could still assume that what we learn in school will last for a lifetime, teaching content knowledge and routine cognitive skills was rightly at the centre of education. Today, the world no longer rewards us just for what we know – Google knows everything – but for what we can do with what we know. If all we do is teach our children what we know, they may remember enough to follow in our footsteps. But it is only if we help to build a reliable compass that they will be able to go anywhere and find their way through this increasingly complex, volatile and ambiguous world. The challenge is to shift in instruction from knowledge transmission to knowledge co-creation, from receiving abstractions in textbooks to learning by experimenting, from summative evaluation to formative monitoring.
                                        
                                        Of course, all this is much easier to say than to do, and the road of educational reform is littered with good ideas that were poorly implemented. The laws, regulations, structures and institutions on which educational reform tends to focus are just like the small visible tip of a huge iceberg. The reason why it is so hard to move school systems is that there is a much larger invisible part under the waterline. This invisible part is about the beliefs, capacities, motivations and fears of the people who are involved in education.
                                        
                                        This is where unexpected collisions occur, because this part of the education system tends to evade the radar screen of public policy. That is why educational leaders are rarely successful with reform unless they build a shared understanding and collective ownership for change, and unless they build capacity and create the right policy climate, with accountability measures designed to encourage innovation rather than compliance.</p>
								    <h4>What we expect of our teachers</h4>
                                    <p style="white-space: pre-line;">
                                    We demand a lot from our teachers. We expect them to have a deep and broad understanding of what they teach and whom they teach, because what teachers know and care about makes such a difference to student learning. That entails professional knowledge (e.g. knowledge about a discipline, knowledge about the curriculum of that discipline, and knowledge about how students learn in that discipline), and knowledge about professional practice so they can create the kind of learning environment that leads to good learning outcomes. It also involves enquiry and research skills that allow them to be lifelong learners and grow in their profession. Students are unlikely to become lifelong learners if they don't see their teachers as lifelong learners.

But we expect much more from our teachers than what appears in their job description. Most people remember at least one of their teachers who took a real interest in their life and aspirations, who helped them understand who they are and discover their passions; and who taught them how to love learning.

We expect teachers to be passionate, compassionate and thoughtful; to encourage students' engagement and responsibility; to respond to students from different backgrounds with different needs, and to promote tolerance and social cohesion; to provide continual assessments of students and feedback; to ensure that students feel valued and included; and to encourage collaborative learning. And we expect teachers themselves to collaborate and work in teams, and with other schools and parents, to set common goals, and plan and monitor the attainment of those goals.

There are aspects that make the job of teachers much more challenging and different from that of other professionals. Teachers need to be experts at multitasking as they respond to many different learner needs all at the same time. They also do their job in a classroom dynamic that is always unpredictable and that leaves teachers no second to think about how to react. Whatever a teacher does, even with just a single student, will be witnessed by all classmates and can frame the way in which the teacher is perceived in the school from that day forward... <a href="https://www.teachermagazine.com/au_en/articles/elevating-the-teaching-profession">more</a>

									<p class="date">By <a href="#">Dominique Russell</a> <span>14 September, 2021</span></p>

                                        Effective teacher-parent relationships and parent engagement in their child’s learning improves student outcomes. Researchers in the United States have surveyed parents and carers of preschoolers about their role in their child’s learning, and the support they’d like from teachers.

The small-scale study found participants prioritise reading development over mathematics at home, lack confidence in fostering mathematics skills with their children, and want more information from teachers on their child’s progress and fun activities to support home-learning.

In their paper, Learning at home: What preschool children’s parents do and what they want to learn from their children’s teachers, Susan Sonnenschein, Michele Stites, and Rebecca Dowling from the University of Maryland Baltimore County, say ‘preschool teachers play an important role in supporting home learning of reading and mathematics. Preschool teachers and parents need to collaborate on home-based activities that support such learning’.

Their survey, which recruited participants through social media, received 126 responses and asked 38 questions to assess the beliefs these parents and carers have about their role in their child’s mathematics and reading development. Almost all were mothers of preschool children (97 per cent), and 92 per cent were considered highly educated, as they had at least a bachelor’s degree.

<h4>Supporting reading and maths in the home</h4>
Most participants (86 per cent) said they believe it’s very important for their children to engage in reading activities at home, and 77 per cent said it’s very important to assist their children with these activities. For mathematics, 68 per cent felt mathematics activities are very important to engage with at home, and 70 per cent said it’s very important to assist their children.

While 65 per cent of participants reported that their children engage in reading activities each day of the week, just 22 per cent said the same for mathematics activities. More time was spent with children on reading activities (29.4 minutes) than mathematics (16.9 minutes). The researchers say this is a troubling finding.

‘As the data in this study show, children not only engage in reading activities more times per week than in mathematics activities, the amount of time they devote to reading and mathematics activities differs and favours reading,’ the authors write. ‘Such a pattern is troubling given the importance of children’s mathematics skills at school entry for subsequent academic development and the importance of mathematics skills for future vocational outcomes.’

Parents and carers were also asked how confident they are that they know what to do to support their child's learning in reading and mathematics. Again, more were confident in supporting reading (40 per cent saying they are very confident) than in mathematics (32 per cent). Just over one-third (35 per cent) said they are not confident in assisting their children with reading, and 44 per cent said the same for mathematics.

‘Although parents may think that reading is more important than mathematics, the difference in children’s reported engagement in such activities may come from parents lacking confidence in how to foster their children’s mathematics skills,’ the report reads.

<h4>What do preschool parents and carers want from teachers?</h4>
The survey uncovered two main sources of information participants want from their children’s teachers: more information on how well their children are doing, and activities they could complete with their children at home that are fun and engaging.

Almost one-quarter of parents and carers (24 per cent) indicated their child’s school did not provide any information or activities to support reading and the figure rose to 37 per cent for mathematics.

When asked what kind of resources they’d like for reading and maths, three specific types emerged as most desirable:

<div style="display: list-item;margin-left: 25px;"> Instructions for activities to do at home (51 per cent would like this for reading, and 42 per cent would like this for maths)</div>
<div style="display: list-item;margin-left: 25px;"> Notes or updates on progress (53 per cent would like this for reading, and 35 per cent would like this for maths)</div>
<div style="display: list-item;margin-left: 25px;"> Toys or games (43 per cent would like this for reading, 45 per cent would like this for maths)</div>
‘We argue that even highly educated parents often lack the confidence to support their young children’s academic growth, particularly in mathematics,’ the researchers conclude. ‘This demonstrates a critical need for teachers to communicate activities and ideas for parents to support learning in the home. If we hope to support the important relationship between the school and home for learning, these considerations need to be addressed.’
